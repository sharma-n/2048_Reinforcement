# Solving 2048 using Reinforcement Learning
This repository aims to build multiple reinforcement learning agents using different techniques to play the well-known 2048 game! As more and more methods are covered, I will try to compare the different approaches in terms of performance and probability of success.

## Todo
- [x] Build initial game code to allow human players
- [ ] Extend game mechanics to allow reinforcement learning agents
- [ ] Build a simple reinforcement learning agent to play the game
